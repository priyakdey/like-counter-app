# Like Counter

A very simple Like counter which keeps a track of total likes and dislikes.
Aim of this project was to start frontend dev with at very basic with vanilla JS - [Ref](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/from-javascript-to-react/updating-ui-with-javascript).
While scrolling through Next-JS docs to see if I can use it, I really liked their doc with step wise explanation.
I think it is very important to understand the hierachy of this JS -> React -> Next.

So decided to make a Counter Application. Seems pretty easy and working.
Next step would be to create another app, with little more than two buttons and routes using vanilla JS.

Attaching a screen record to show how things work:
